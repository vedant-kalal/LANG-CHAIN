                "**Definition:** These are **fundamental building blocks** for structuring execution.\n",
                "**Purpose:** They **help orchestrate execution** by defining how different Runnables interact (sequentially, in parallel, conditionally, etc.).\n",

                "- `RunnableMap` → Maps the same input across multiple functions.\n",
                "- `RunnableBranch` → Implements **conditional execution** (if-else logic).\n",
                "- `RunnableLambda` → Wraps **custom Python functions** into Runnables.\n",
                "- `RunnablePassthrough` → Just forwards input as **output** (acts as a placeholder).\n"
